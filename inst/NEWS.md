__MEDseq: Mixtures of Exponential-Distance Models with Covariates__   
===================================================================

## MEDseq v1.1.0 - (_3<sup>rd</sup> release [minor update]: 2020-03-30_)
### New Features, Improvements, and Bug Fixes
* Significant efficiency gains when ignoring duplicates in the presence of weights:  
    * before, unique cases were defined as unique sequence/covariates/weight combinations,  
    * now, cases with different weights that are otherwise duplicates are treated as duplicates.
* `MEDseq_stderr` is provided for computing the standard errors of the  
  coefficients for the covariates in the gating network via either the  
  weighted likelihood bootstrap or jackknife methods.
* Small robustifications in the presence of empty components.
* Fixed `get_MEDseq_results` when `what="MAP"` and non-noise models are chosen.
* Fixed bug related to the colours used in the vignette plots.
* Odds ratios now returned (and printed) when calling `summary` on `x$gating`.
* Cosmetic fixes to `plot.MEDseq` when `type="clusters"` for small sample sizes.
* Other small cosmetic plotting  & reference-formatting changes.
* Spell-checking of documentation and fixes to `donttest` examples.

## MEDseq v1.0.1 - (_2<sup>nd</sup> release [patch update]: 2019-12-10_)
### Bug Fixes & Miscellaneous Edits
* Speed-ups to E-step, especially for models with a noise component.
* Clarifications and improvements to documentation and examples.
